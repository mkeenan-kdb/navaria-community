# Navaria

**A free, open-source platform for creating and hosting your own language-learning content — with full control and privacy over your content, students, and data.** Feel free to use this for yourself, your business, your classes, tribe, community, or any other purpose.

Navaria is **software you deploy yourself**.

By following the setup guides in this repository, you can create **your own private or public instance** of Navaria — fully under your control — and use it to teach **your own language**, with **your own lessons**, for **your own students or community**.

Although I have a special interest in preserving endangered languages, Navaria is not limited to this. I have created this project to be a general language learning platform, and included features that allow the app to be customised and extended in various ways. Dive in!

### What you get when you deploy Navaria

- 🏗️ **Your own instance** (not shared with anyone else)
- 🔐 **Full control over content, users, and courses**
- 🧑‍🎓 **Private access for your students** (or public, if you choose)
- 🎨 Optional custom branding and domain
- 💾 Your own database and storage
- 🚫 No platform lock-in, no ads, no fees

Navaria is **free and open source (MIT License)**.

You may:
- Use it privately or publicly  
- Modify it for your needs  
- Deploy it for schools, communities, or commercial projects  
- Share it with your students under your own rules  

👉 **If you can follow step-by-step instructions, you can run Navaria. No prior platform experience required.**

> **Note:** A public *community instance* also exists for shared experimentation and collaboration — but it is entirely optional. Most educators and organisations deploy their **own private instance**. The community instance is **empty** and waiting for **you** to create content. If you would like to create content for the community version, you can contact me and I'll add you to the admins list, then you can create content with no-code for the wider community to use.

- **Empower** educators with a complete, customisable learning platform

---

## 🌐 Community Version

You can access the live community version here: [Navaria Community App](https://navaria-community.navaria.pages.dev/)

This instance is running for the community. It's currently empty, waiting for **you** to create content. If you would like to create content for the community version, you can contact me and I'll help you get started with admin access.

## ✍️ A Message from the Author

# Navaria — Freedom for Language Preservation

Navaria was built following my experience co-founding a language-learning startup focused on language preservation. Differences in vision and values ultimately led me to believe the language and its community deserved a more open, honest, and independent foundation.

Navaria is the result of that belief.

---

A Modern, Independent Foundation

Navaria was developed from the ground up in just 30 days as a strict clean-room implementation. It is a fully independent platform designed for speed, flexibility, and long-term sustainability.

- Authored from scratch
  - Every line of code was designed and implemented by me in a single month of focused development.
- Modern technology stack
  - Built using a high-performance language and architecture chosen specifically for scalability, maintainability, and longevity.
- Built for the public good
  - Unlike proprietary platforms, Navaria is transparent, extensible, and open — owned by the communities that rely on it.

---

The Mission

The best response to closed systems is open ones.
The best way to protect cultural and linguistic heritage is to ensure the tools that support it can never be locked away.

Navaria belongs to the community. Forever. Free.

If you are an educator, school, or member of a community working to preserve an endangered language, this project is for you — with no fees, no restrictions, and no corporation controlling your access.

— Mícheál
